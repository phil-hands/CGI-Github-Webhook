        Enforce autoflush inside CGI::Github::Webhook::run() to avoid
        race condition. Fixes #2. Thanks to Slaven Rezić for testing!

        Add ugly hack to dummy CGI script to be executed with the
        correct perl binary. Hopefully fixes #1 and most test failures
        with CPAN testers.

        Use CGI::Test for the test suite.

        Always use "sub { … }" around default values. (Needed to
        support Moo ≤ 1.000008.)

        Fix isa test for log: The log doesn't need to exist in
        advance, but the directory it will be in needs to exist.

        Fix "Use of uninitialized value in subroutine entry" when no
        payload is passed.

        Sanitize JSON decoding error message so it can be used inside
        an JSON string.

        Add more tests.

        Skip t/basic-functionality.t under dos-ish operating systems
        as it contains Bourne shell code.

        Add Shields.io based passed/failed/errored badges and hooks to
        put the according one into a deployment directory.

        Also verify a failed authentication case in t/methods.t.

        $PATH. Thanks Slaven Rezić (SREZIC)!
